# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict **heart disease** risk using **machine learning models** based on various health parameters. The dataset contains information like age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, helping us analyze key risk factors.

## 📂 Files Included
- **heart.csv** – Dataset containing patient health records.
- **HeartDisease.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook with data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- **HeartDisease_model.pkl** – Trained model file for future predictions.

## 🔍 Data & Features
The dataset includes:
- **Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Heart Rate**, etc.
- **Target Variable**: 1 = Heart Disease, 0 = No Heart Disease

## 📊 Steps Performed
1️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed distributions, correlations, and visualized risk factors.  
2️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, normalized data, and prepared for model training.  
3️⃣ **Model Training & Evaluation**: Compared **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost**.  
4️⃣ **Model Selection**: Chose the best-performing model based on accuracy and saved it as `HeartDisease_model.pkl`.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for implementation
